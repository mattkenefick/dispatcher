## Instructions

In your actual project, install `handtrackjs`

    npm install --save handtrackjs


And for now, until we figure out what's up, include handtrackjs script either
via CDN or a local file. Drop it in the head.

We'll come up with a better solution later.

    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/handtrackjs@0.0.13/dist/handtrack.min.js"></script>
